AR Globe allows users to explore historic and old globes from the [David Rumsey map collection](https://www.davidrumsey.com/) in own space with augmented reality.

The old globes float in your room in front of you â€“ you can move towards them and around them using your screen, as well as move inside of them. They can be zoomed in and out and turned as well.
Seven different globes can be explored in great detail.

AR Globe is both an educational tool for understanding history and a wonderful game at the same time.

Try it:
- [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/ch/app/ar-globe-david-rumsey-maps/id1315676574) on iPhone and iPad with ARKit
- [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.davidrumseymapcollection.arglobe) on Android devices with ARCore
- [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nl4fbbclr8v) on HoloLens 2 with Mixed Reality

It is developed with the latest Unity game engine. Lowres equirectangular textures are embeded in the app even in offline settings, while high-res online tiled textures in Mercator are loaded on demand with patched MB SDK.

All textures were generated with [MapTiler Engine](https://www.maptiler.com/engine/).
With a bit of extra effort it should be possible to port the Unity code base into Vision Pro, Meta Oculus or other AR/VR platforms.

This R&D project is succeeded by [cross-platform augmented reality maps in JavaScript](https://maptiler.com/ar/) available as component for web developers.
